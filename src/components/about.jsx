                    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Matthew Tung!</strong> I am a (pho)fun-loving, always running guy who 
                       loves dogs and working on all things technology! I've had a passion for computers
                       and robotics ever since I was in middle school, and I hope to use my skills to make
                       the world a better and more interesting place.</p>

                    <p>I am currently finishing my Master's at MIT working on Autonomous Surface Vehicles.
                       I have a great interest in robotics, IoT, and using software and hardware to solve
                       problems and make technology fun.
                       <br></br>
                       In my spare time I enjoy running, cooking, playing video games, working with gadgets, dancing, filming and
                       editing videos.
